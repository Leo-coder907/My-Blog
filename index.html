<p>This is one of the times where my internet is not working because all the monthly data got used and i have no idea how it was used so soon,I didnt even use the internet that much as I had <u>exams</u> this month and my holidays have began.<b>Even in my summer vacation the monthly data didnt get finished so fast!.</p></b>
<br>
I always (well not always) ask my mother to increase our internet's data plan so that it wont get ever so easily and so soon,but oh god does she ever listen to me.I asked her to atleast increase the data plan as my birthday gift but she didnt even consider that.
<br>
I also told her that it will benefit all of our family as my mother needs internet to work from home,but she didnt even consider that (you gotta admit it was a good point).
<br>
It's been 3 months since my birthday got over and i still didn't get my b'day gift at all.
<br>
<p>
And i dont know what birthday gift im going to get but i hope its good.</p>

<b>Time-4:30 p.m</b>

Ok guys I'm back with some more news now,so basically my internet is working again.You might be wondering now how my internet is working even when the <u>monthly data is finished</u>,well even I dont know the answer myself for now i guess.So what hapenned was basically yesterday an <b>employee working with my ISP called my mom</b> asking if we raised a complaint that our <u>internet is not working</u> and she said no and the employee said that he will call after <b><u>5 or 10 mins</b></u> but he didn't and after that happened i noticed on my mom's work laptop that the <u><b>internet was not slow anymore</u></b>,to prove my suspicion <u>I ran a internet speed test with ookla</u> and i found out that my internet is working perfectly fine again.
